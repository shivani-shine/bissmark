          <p className="text-center">
            Ionic developers build Angular-based applications, and the code is
            written in Iconic, which other developers then use for building
            progressive web applications. The Ionic developers build UI grids
            exclusively for mobile devices and tablets. Our team of experts has
            hands-on experience in making and deploying cloud-based platforms.
            Ionic developers integrate ionic plugins to help access the device
            and the file system. The third-party plugins are written in Native
            codes, and binary cases are included in the project.
